# Divine-s-Food
A basic game made in order to better understand Godot Engine.

An arena-like game, where you comand a deity of hamburger-throwing powers. Move using WASD, and shoot using the mouse left click. Shoot the clients in order to send them to your restaurant. If you hit a security guard, it will make them angry and they will try to hit you. If they do, you get paralized for a bit.
